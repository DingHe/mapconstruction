  "body": "# Map Construction Algorithms\r\nEnabled by the ubiquitous generation of geo-referenced tracking data, there has been a recent surge of algorithms that construct street maps from tracking data.\r\n\r\nHowever, visual inspection is still the most common approach to evaluate the quality of the algorithms, and cross-comparison of different algorithms is very rare, since algorithms and constructed maps are generally not publicly available. There is a lack of benchmark data, and quantitative evaluation with suitable distance measures has just recently begun.\r\n\r\nThis repository will provide access to\r\n\r\n* a set of map generation algorithms,\r\n* data sets including tracking data as well as respective map datasets, and\r\n* various distance measures to assess the quality of the constructed maps.\r\n\r\nAs they become available, we encourage interested scientists and developers to add their source code to this site.\r\n\r\n## Citing the work\r\n\r\nShould you use the source code and/or data from this site, please cite also the following paper:\r\n\r\n> M.
